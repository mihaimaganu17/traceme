// reflectance ùëÖ, or it can sometimes scatter (with probabilty 1‚àíùëÖ) with no attenuation (where a
// ray that isn't scattered is just absorbed into the material). It could also be a mixture of both
// those strategies. We will choose to always scatter, so implementing Lambertian materials becomes
